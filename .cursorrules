# Project-Specific Rules Override

# These rules override or supplement the default rules in CLAUDE.md

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

**DO NOT run Laravel Pint manually** - This project has a pre-commit Git hook (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`) that automatically runs Laravel Pint on staged PHP files before each commit. The hook will format the code and re-stage the formatted files automatically.

- Code formatting is handled automatically by the pre-commit hook, so manual Pint execution is not needed.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint` or `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` manually.
- The pre-commit hook ensures all staged PHP files are properly formatted before commits.

## Testing

**DO NOT write test files unless explicitly requested** - Only create or modify test files when the user explicitly asks you to write tests, create tests, or mentions testing in their request.

- Do not automatically create test files when implementing new features or fixing bugs.
- Do not suggest writing tests unless the user asks about testing.
- If the user wants tests, they will explicitly request them.

## Documentation

**DO NOT create or write documentation files unless explicitly requested** - Only create or modify documentation files (like `.md` files, README updates, etc.) when the user explicitly asks you to write documentation, create docs, or mentions documentation in their request.

- Do not automatically create documentation files when implementing new features or fixing bugs.
- Do not suggest writing documentation unless the user asks about it.
- If the user wants documentation, they will explicitly request it.
